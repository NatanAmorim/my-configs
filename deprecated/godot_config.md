## About

> [!NOTE]\
>
> I'm still learning Godot in my short free time and have not used Godot in a serious/professional project yet, so what you see here may not be the best for a professional solution.

This is for sharing the Godot 4.x plugins, assets and templates I use.

> [!WARNING]\
>
> **A lot** of the things will be removed in the future as I figure out what is useful to me and what is not.
